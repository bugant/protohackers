# 1 - Prime Time

Accept TCP connections.

Whenever you receive a conforming request, send back a correct response, and wait for another request.

Whenever you receive a malformed request, send back a single malformed response, and disconnect the client.

Make sure you can handle at least 5 simultaneous clients.
